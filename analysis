# Script Name: analysis
# Description: Analyze a board game dataset (TSV format) to extract statistical insights.
#              This script performs the following:
#              - Finds the most popular game mechanic (column 13) and domain (column 14)
#              - Calculates average values for publication year, rating, and complexity
#              - Computes Pearson correlation coefficients between:
#                  • Year of publication and average rating
#                  • Game complexity and average rating
#              It handles data cleaning, multiple comma-separated values, and reports
#              errors for missing or insufficient data.
# Usage: ./analysis <file>

# Check the number of arguments
# If the number is not 1, print error message

# Find the most popular mechanic
# 1. Extract Mechanics field (column 13) and skip empty entries and header
# 2. Spread multiple mechanics (comma-separated) into individual lines
# 3. Remove leading and trailing spaces or tabs from each mechanic
# 4. Remove blank lines caused by empty or malformed entries
# 5. Replace internal spaces with underscores for reliable field separation
# 6. Sort all mechanics alphabetically
# 7. Count each unique mechanic
# 8. Sort mechanics by frequency in descending order
# 9. Select the most frequent mechanic
# 10. Print formatted output with mechanic name and count, restoring spaces
